- Student Name: Samu Pietil√§
- Week 5

---

## Peer assessment

- Samu: 5
- Mika: 5
- Peppi: 5, Really felt that she catched up a lot this week.
- Mohamed: It is hard to say. I feel he deserves 2 for the attendance, he did not collaborate with our group at all. But i feel he deserves 3-4 for the effort. He started from the beginning from the course material to understand better the matter of the course.

## Reflection

### Challenges Faced:

- All my challenges are to set up the project, we have all done something on our own and we should put everything together so it would be more easier to continue.

---

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

- Key Learning:

1. Lot of repetition with the API server. Really feel like it is now learned.(feels good.)
2. Hashing was a good and interesting thing to learn.

---

### Coping Strategies:

- Academic Progress:

1. Got more confident with the backend.

- Soft Skills Development:

1.  thankfully in liveshare sessions copilot does not work so the syntax has to be learned as well.

---

### Project Management:

- I would say this is in a bad shape.. we have this week to make this right.

---

### Next Steps:

- Next week goals:

1. PUT EVERYTHING WHAT WE HAVE DONE TOGETHER.
2. check Scrimba.

- Week 5: 9.2.2024
