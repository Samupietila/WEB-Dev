## Reflection

### Challenges Faced:

- This week there was lot to learn, so my biggest challenges are in building the big picture how everything works and gets linked to each other. Also worried about not understanding the syntax, so thats something i need to put some hours.

---

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

- Key Learning:

1. mostly frontend, i liked the pair programming, because there was actually something to do instead of just copy paste. Also both of my pairs where really nice people and good to work with.

---

### Coping Strategies:

- Academic Progress:

1. I hope all this is somehow starting to get together in my head, not yet, but i feel that motivation is building up towards learning the matter.

- Soft Skills Development:

1.  Copilot is way too good, i think i should turn it off while doing the activities, all the syntax is going to be hard to learn if AI does it all for me.

---

### Project Management:

- I made Trello Board for us and hopefully we will be more organized.

---

### Next Steps:

- Next week goals:

1. Make sure Peppi and Mohamed knows what to do and give them enough time to complete all tasks considering our project
2. Work with Figma if there is any freetime.
