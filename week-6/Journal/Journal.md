## Reflection

### Challenges Faced:

- Challenges in competition, but those were only positive challenges and we learned a lot.
- Biggest challenges are that i cant even remember how to do a simple function to a specific thing without looking an example, because the lack of syntax knowledge.

---

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

- Key Learning:

1. Frontend authentication. Building up the home page was cool. useField and useContext were neat!
2. Really liked the competition this week! Would like to do them on my own too, so i would learn even more.

---

### Coping Strategies:

- Academic Progress:

1. I feel i really understand how everything that we have been taught works, so i feel happy.

- Soft Skills Development:

1. At some points i was on fire with problem-solving, but in the last challenges we faced in competition, i had no clue what was wrong with our code.

---

### Project Management:

- Still bad. But i guess we are going to be ready with our project within the given time.

---

### Next Steps:

- Next week goals:

1. hopefully we have a working feed page next week, and we can start sprint 4 on time.

- Week 7: 3.3.2024
